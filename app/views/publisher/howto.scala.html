                    <p>
                        Create a RAML file to describe your API. (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scapig/api-example/master/conf/hello-world.raml">Example RAML file</a>)
                    </p>
                    <a href="https://raml.org/"><img src="/assets/images/raml.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" alt="RAML"/></a>
                    <br/><br/>

                    <h2>Publish an API</h2>
                    You can publish an API from a RAML file with the following command:
                    <pre>curl -XPOST http://localhost:8040/publish --data &#64;ramlFile</pre>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Definition</h2>

                    An API is defined by its <b>context</b> and its <b>version</b>.<br/>
                    It contains a number of endpoints which can be either open, application-restricted or user-restricted.<br/>
                    The API context is determined by the prefix of the API request while the version is determined by the Accept header.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <h2>Versioning</h2>

                    There is one RAML file per API Version.<br/>
                    The API Gateway will select the version depending of the Accept Header sent in the request.<br/>
                    For example, <code>Accept: application/vnd.scapig.1.0+json</code> will route to version 1.0.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <h2>Lifecycle</h2>

                    The API lifecycle is defined by the status published in the RAML file which can have any of the following:
                    <table class="table table-striped">
                        <thead>

                                    However they will be warned on the developer hub that they are very likely to change and should expect breaking changes.</td>

                                <td>The version is not available anymore on the platform and the gateway will reject requests using this version.</td>
                            </tr>

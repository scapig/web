                    The API Gateway component is scapig-gateway.

                    It will validate the authorization and proxy the request if successful.

                    The following validations are done:
                    <h3>API Endpoint Identification</h3>
                        The API Gateway will identify which API and endpoint matches the request.
                        A 404 (Not Found) will be returned if no endpoint can be identified.
                    <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
                        Should the endpoint be Application or User, the API Gateway will validate that the application is
                    subscribed to the API.
                        A 403 (Forbidden) will be returned in the event it is not.
                    <h3>Authorization</h3>
                    For an Application-restricted endpoint, the API Gateway will validate that the server token is valid
                    For a User-restricted endpoint, the API Gateway will validate that the token is valid and that it contains the
                    scope required by the endpoint.
                    <h3>Rate Throttling</h3>
                    The API Gateway will validate that the application did not reach yet its threshold of the number of calls authorized.
                    A 429 (Too Many Requests) will be returned in the event it has.
                    <h3>Proxy</h3>
                    If all the validations above are successful, the request will then be proxied to its end service.
                    When the token used in the header is a <b>Sandbox</b> token, this will be to the Sandbox endpoint.
                    Otherwise, it will be to the live endpoint.

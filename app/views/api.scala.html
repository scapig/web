                    <h3>API Definition</h3>

                    An API is identified by its context and its version.<br/>
                    The API Definition is derived from the RAML file being published to the <a href="/publisher">scapig-publisher</a>.<br/>
                    The API will contain a number of endpoints which can be either open, application-restricted or user-restricted.<br/>
                    The API context is determined by the prefix of the API request while the version is determined by the Accept header.<br/>

                    <h3>API Lifecycle</h3>
                    APIs follow a lifecycle which is defined by their status on the RAML file when they get published.
